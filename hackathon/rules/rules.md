# 🏁 Finalist Requirements – Short & Clean Summary

## 1. Purpose (Top 5 only)

Build a **live application** that demonstrates how your model can be used in the **real world**.

You must clearly answer:

> _How can your solution be applied in the real world?_

---

## 2. Hard Restrictions

- ✅ Use **only the provided datasets** (train & test)
- ❌ No external data
- ❌ No AutoML tools
- ❌ No LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- ❌ No external help, discussions, or idea sharing
- ✅ Only publicly available, free pretrained models (classical only)

---

## 3. Team & Accounts

- Max **3 members** per team
- **One Kaggle account** per participant
- No information/code/model exchange between teams
- After a submission: no members can join or leave

---

## 4. Submissions & Leaderboard

- Max **40 total submissions**
- Select **2 final submissions** for private scoring
- Public leaderboard: **40%** of test set
- Private leaderboard: **60%** of test set
- Final ranking uses the **best private score**

---

## 5. Verification & Presentations

### Stage 1 – Reproducibility

- Submit the exact code/notebook
- Must reproduce the leaderboard score exactly

### Stage 2 – Technical Presentation

- 5 min presentation + 10–15 min Q&A
- Cover: methodology, model, features, preprocessing, results, challenges

---

## 6. Stage 3 – Real‑World Application Demo (Top 5)

You must build a **live app** using your trained model.

Allowed frameworks:

- Streamlit, Gradio, Flask (or similar)

The demo must include:

- Live model inference
- Clear real‑world use cases
- Simple UI for non‑technical users
- Deployment requirements & constraints
- Business value and impact
- Scalability & maintenance considerations

---

## 7. Data Security

- Do not share or redistribute the data
- Protect it from unauthorized access

---

## 8. Final Ranking Criteria

- Model performance (private leaderboard score)
- Technical presentation quality (Stage 2)
- Real‑world demo quality (Stage 3)
